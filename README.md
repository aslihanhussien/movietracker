# MovieTracker

It is an app to search for movies and keep track of your watching preferences.



##### What are the features?

* Search for movies and see details about them
* Save movies if you want to watch later
* Mark movies as watched
* Create a list for your favorite movies
* See statistics about your movie preferences




##### How I built it

* React - for building the interface
* Tailwind CSS - for styling
* OMDB API - to get movie information
* localStorage - to save your lists

  

##### Running it locally

If you want to run this app:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run npm install
3. Copy your API key from OMDB
4. Update your env file
5. Run npm run dev
6. Open in your browser

   

##### Features I really like

The stats page was my favorite part to build. It tracks which genres you enjoy watching the most.

###### Things I learned

This was my first time with:

##### Note

This app stores everything in your browser. So when you clear your browser data, your saved movies will be gone. It is a personal tracker, not for sharing lists with others.
